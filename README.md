# README

Just a pet project where I test some experimental-ish stuff with Rails.

It monitors newsletters and semantically indexes the links in them so I can quickly find useful things that I swear have seen before but just can't find them.

I've used the project to experiment with nested jsonb-backed models, view components and HTMX + Hyperscript.
